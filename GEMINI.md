- this project was originally called insecure-xml-proxy but is now called RSS-THE-PLANET
- Please never touch KVS.js as this file contains a lot of sensitive auth code
- Avoid changing logic inside of existing function. You can change arguments and things like that but the actual logic can be sensitive
- Always run both 'npm test' (Wrangler) and 'npm run test:node' (Node.js) before finishing a task.
- do not run tests/proxy-test-end2end-w3c-validation.js because those require a separate server to be running
